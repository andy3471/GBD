# Generic Beat Detector (GBD)

The *Generic Beat Detector (GBD)* strives to deliver an industrial strength library and IoT framework for realtime beat 
detection (and soon other DSP analysis operations) for live music streams. 

## Description

GBD primarily consists of a library for music DSP analysis, and support plugins for 
audio signal routing between hosts.

</p>

This GBD release (v0.21) offers low-latency and realtime beat detection for
live/playing music streams:

* Bass beat (e.g. kick drum) detection (below 200Hz)
* Detection of snare-like hits (between 3KHz and 10KHz)
* Detection of cymbals-like sounds (above 15KHz)

## Targeted Users

The GBD framework is primarily designed for the __IoT maker__ industry and community. The 
target is to supply __robust__, industrial-strength __realtime__ music 
beat detection (and soon other music DSP analysis) engines for makers 
working with __commodity hardware__ and developing setups or products similar to,
for example, the Philips Hue Disco framework.

## Operation

The Raspberry Pi computer is used as the platform of choice for the GBD core given the board's popularity with the IoT maker community. The *GBD core* (PCM routing server and DSP library) is GNU/Linux based. The GBD client and/or audio applications
may execute on a remote host which need not be a GNU/Linux system. This is discussed at greater depth in [*GBD Architecture*](https://github.com/generic-beat-detector/GBD/wiki/The-GBD-IoT-Framework#gbd-architecture).

With realtime beat detection, as an audio stream is routed through the GBD framework, the 
GBD music DSP analysis library delivers beat counts to Linux POSIX SHM. 
The IoT maker can then use this information to synchronize the control of light bulbs/leds to the 
music's beats. Check this OpenGL LED emulation on [*Youtube*](https://youtu.be/1wmrO51TZqA). This beat
detection mode is referred to as *GBD Standard*.

Bear in mind that while GBD's realtime beat detection is sturdy, it still requires some "compliance" on the part of the user
if it is to function in the most generic manner possible, i.e. across the variety of music genres. For the best results, the quality of the music should be that of professional studio CD recordings: preferably WAV uncompressed PCM or, at least, an encoding by an industry-standard audio format converter. For example, pirated `.mp3` downloads from the Internet (i.e. poorly encoded or transcoded formats) or amateur recordings are likely to produce unsatisfactory results. These issues are discussed more fully
